# door43.org

This is the source for door43.org website.  Note that it does not include the files that show up at door43.org/u/ as those are created by the [tX conversion app](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/wiki/tX-Development-Architecture).

## Project Overview

The http://door43.org site provides a front end view to all of the content in the Door43 ecosystem.  The source content on http://git.door43.org is converted into HTML and uploaded to the correct location on http://door43.org.

Whenever a source repository is updated, it notifies (via webhook) the conversion app to convert the content and publish it online.  A repository like https://git.door43.org/jag3773/ULB-pt-br will become a published web page at http://door43.org/u/jag3773/ULB-pt-br/.

The pages outside of the `/u/` location on the site are generated by Jekyll and provide localized navigation, Door43 project information, and curated content recommendations for each language.

## Project Management

We use the [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) plugin to manage this project with Boards and Burndown charts.  We do one week Sprints following Scrum methodology.  If you don't have the (free) Zenhub plugin you can still see the [issue list](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/issues) and the [milestones](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/milestones) that we have created.

If you would like to submit an issue,  please do so [here](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/issues/new).  Be sure to follow the template that is provided on a new issue.  You can also see the [New Door43 Roadmap](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43.org/wiki/New-Door43-Roadmap) to get an idea of our overall priorities and potential timeline to implementation.

## Developer Quickstart Information

### Door43.org Jekyll Site

#### Installation

To setup a development environment for developing on this site, you need to run the following commands (after cloning this repo):

    cd door43.org
    bundle install

If you do not have the `bundle` executable, then you'll need to run `sudo gem install bundle` first.

#### Updating dependencies

    bundle update

##### Setup

If you need `s3cmd`, then install it from http://s3tools.org/download.  It's as easy as `sudo pip install s3cmd`, `yum install s3cmd` or `sudo apt-get install s3cmd` for Linux.

You will also need to ensure that you have a configuration file for `s3cmd` available as `s3cfg-prod` at the root of the repo.  Both the assets and s3cfg-prod locations are excluded from git in .gitignore.


#### Publishing Setup

There are two branches that are built and deployed to S3 by Travis CI:

* `develop`
* `master`

The develop branch may be seen online at http://test-door43.org.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

The master branch is available at https://live.door43.org (soon to be at https://door43.org).

#### Pre Production Testing

You may run `make test`, or `make build`, or `make serve` to test and review your changes locally.  Once the `cibuild.sh` script passes successfully locally, push `test` branch.  Follow setup instructions in `s3_test_push.sh` and then run the script  `s3_test_push.sh`.  Your changes will then be uploaded to `http://test-door43.org.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

#### Develop Testing

After Pre-production Testing you commit your changes and make a pull request against develop branch.  After it has been merged Travis will automatically deploy to dev site for further testing before deploying to production.  Your changes will then be uploaded to `http://dev-door43.org.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

#### Push to Production

If Travis CI has built and deployed the `develop` branch successfully, you create a pull request to merge it into the `master` branch.  When this has been merged, Travis will automatically deploy yours changes to production.  Your changes should be visible within 5 minutes on `https://live.door43.org`

#### Syncing Assets

Assets (binary things like images) are housed on cdn.door43.org/assets for this site. This assets folder is a Resilio Sync folder shared among the developers (ask if you need access).

##### Syncing

In order to synchronize the assets to the cdn S3 bucket you may now run `make assets`.  This process will **not remove** assets from the /assets folder, only add or update existing files.

### Running Unit Tests
*Note: we do not run these tests directly from InteliJ or Pycharm environments.  They are launched from the command-line and debugging is done within Chrome using it's JavaScript Debugger with it's 'Developer Tools'.*

#### Adding Tests
- tests are js files in ./test/spec
- will also need to add new test spec files to ./test/SpecRunner.html

#### Running Tests Locally using Karma
- to make sure we have dependencies do `npm install`
- to run the tests do `npm run-script test-phantom`

*Note: if Karma tests fail, you can find help by looking at karma log file (`karma.log`).

#### Viewing Local Code Coverage
- coverage reports are generated automatically when you run the previous step `Running Tests Locally using Karma`
- coverage reports will be in coverage folder - open coverage/PhantomJS*/lcov-report/index.html in browser to view.

#### Debugging Tests Locally using Karma
*Note: we do not run these tests directly from InteliJ or Pycharm environments.  They are launched from the command-line and debugging is done within Chrome using it's JavaScript Debugger with it's 'Developer Tools'.*
- to make sure we have dependencies do `npm install`
- to debug the tests do `./karma_start_debug.sh`
- in Chrome Browser open to `http://localhost:9876/#` and then click on Debug
- then open Chrome's "Developer Tools" (on current Chrome click on the three vertical dots in upper right then select More Tools/Developer Tools), set breakpoints (click Sources tab, js files are under base/test/spec) and then do refresh.
- when done debugging, do `./karma_stop.sh` to stop karma running
