## Attribution of Door43 Contributors

When importing a resource (e.g. a book, Bible study, etc.) into Door43, the original work must be attributed as specified by the open license under which it is available. For example, the artwork used in Open Bible Stories is available under an open license and is clearly attributed on the project's [main page](https://door43.org/en/obs).

Contributors to projects on Door43 agree that **the attribution that occurs automatically in the revision history of every page is sufficient attribution for their work**. That is, every contributor to a translation of Open Bible Stories into another language is listed as "the Door43 World Missions Community" or something to that effect. The individual contributions of each individual contributor are preserved in the revision history for that translation.
