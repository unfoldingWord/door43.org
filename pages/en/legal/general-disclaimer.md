Door43 is an online open-content collaborative website; that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups working to develop a common resource of human knowledge. The structure of the project allows anyone with an Internet connection to alter its content. Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.

That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information in Door43; most of the time you will. However, **Door43 cannot guarantee the theological accuracy of the information found here**. The content of any given article may recently have been changed, vandalized or altered by someone whose opinion does not correspond with the Statement of Faith.

What this means is: content on Door43 is in a state of transition and development, so judge the content you find on Door43 on its own merit, instead of assuming that it has been reviewed and guaranteed.

### No formal peer review

Door43 is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or engage in casual peer review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even articles that have been vetted by informal peer review may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view them.

**None of the contributors, sponsors, administrators or anyone else connected with Door43 in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate content or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.**
